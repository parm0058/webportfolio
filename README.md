For My Web P1rotfilio,first of all I have to make a three files for the 1)Index.html 2)project.css 3)main.js files

First Problems:
My first problem i face for protfilio is the grids.According to my idea I have to set up grid first.
And finally I got it.

Second One:
I am little bit confused in the my design and I waste my so much time for think.But now I got this Design.And I am so happy.

Third Problem:
I want use little bit javascript and I used it.But I also got confused in javascript too.Then finally I got the my photos using 
Javascript.

And,yes I learned alot during the Development of the my protfilio.
For Example I learn that how to make a design according you draw before.It was an good experience for me.And I learned a good coding too.
